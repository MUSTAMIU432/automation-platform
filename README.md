# Automation Platform

Automation Platform is a system for turning real-world problems into
delivered automation:

```
PROBLEM → IDEA → VALIDATION → AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITY → REQUIREMENTS
→ PROPOSAL → DEVELOPER/TEAM → PROJECT → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING
→ DEPLOYMENT → IMPACT
```

Individuals, universities, private institutions, government institutions,
organizations, departments, developers, and development teams can submit
problems and ideas, have them validated into automation opportunities, and
see them through to delivered, measurable impact.

## Project Status

This repository is in **Sprint 0 — Foundation**, and the foundation is
substantially established:

- Django backend
- React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL (foundation schema only)
- Environment configuration
- Testing (backend and frontend)
- Code quality tooling
- GitHub Actions CI (validation only, no deployment)

**Business functionality is not yet implemented.** There are no business
domains, and identity/authentication begins in Sprint 1. The security
baseline (S0-011) and the branch audit (S0-012) are still to come. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for current vs. target
architecture, and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what has landed.

## Target Architecture (summary)

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS, GraphQL client
- **Backend:** Django, modular monolith organized by business domain
- **API:** GraphQL primary, REST for infrastructure-only concerns
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Async processing:** Redis + Celery (planned)
- **AI:** centralized gateway/service abstraction (planned)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible object storage (planned)

Full details: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
