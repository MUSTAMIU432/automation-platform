/**

 * assumed valid; if that doesn't resolve to a user (no token yet, or an
 * expired/invalid one), the existing refresh mechanism is tried exactly
 * once, and `me` is checked again with whatever token that produces. Never
 * loops beyond that single refresh attempt - a failed refresh (or a `me`
 * that still fails afterwards) resolves to `null`, not another retry.
 *
 * Uses `refreshAccessToken` rather than `refreshTokenRequest` so this
 * mount-time attempt shares its one-in-flight promise with any proactive
 * refresh already running or about to: the refresh cookie is single-use, so
 * two overlapping refreshes would make the second one fail on an
 * already-revoked credential and sign the user out for no reason.
 *
 * Used for the mount-time bootstrap below. `login`/`loginWithGoogle`
 * deliberately don't route through this - their own mutation's returned
 * `user` is already a fresh, server-validated result from the same
 * request, and re-querying `me` immediately afterwards would just be an
 * extra round trip proving what the mutation already established.
