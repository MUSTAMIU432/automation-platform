# GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: the ID-token flow used here verifies a

# Cache framework
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Three aliases, deliberately separated even where they point at the same
# place:
#
#   default           general-purpose caching. Nothing security-critical may
#                     ever depend on this one.
#   replay_protection used *only* by identity.google_oauth to record Google ID
#                     tokens that have already been consumed.
#   auth_throttle     used *only* by identity.throttling to count
#                     authentication attempts.
#
# The latter two are security-critical and therefore deliberately isolated:
# each can be pointed at a different shared server than general caching,
# neither is ever cleared as part of routine cache housekeeping, and
# production.py refuses to start if either resolves to a per-process backend.
#
# In one process, a per-process in-memory cache is complete protection: a
# replayed token is rejected, and an over-limit request refused, by the very
# same worker that recorded the state. Across processes it is not - worker 1
# accepts a Google credential that worker 2 has never seen, and worker 2
# permits another ten login attempts after worker 1 stopped at five - so
# anything that runs as more than one process needs a backend every worker
# shares. CACHE_URL selects it (Redis, Memcached, a database, ...); it is
# required in every deployed environment precisely because that is where
# "more than one process" is the norm.
