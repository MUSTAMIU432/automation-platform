"""
Organization-scoped authorization.

Every check in this module is scoped to an organization: the question is
never "may this user do X" but "may this user do X *in this organization*",
and the answer is derived from the user's ACTIVE membership of that
organization and the permissions on the roles attached to that membership.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT do:

1. **No organization-level permission for creating an organization.** See
   `create_organization_for_user`'s docstring for the full bootstrap
   argument. `ORGANIZATION_CREATE` exists as a permission *record* and is
   granted to the Owner role for display and completeness, but it is never
   used as a gate - requiring it would be circular, since the membership
   that carries it cannot exist until the organization does.

2. **No client-supplied identity.** Nothing here reads a role, an
   organization or a user from a request. Callers pass the authenticated
   `User` (resolved once, from the access token, by
   `identity.authentication.get_authenticated_user`) and the organization or
   ids that the operation is about; this module decides whether that pair is
   allowed. A resolver that wanted to authorize differently would have to
   bypass all of it.
