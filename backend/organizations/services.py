    Create an organization, and bootstrap the caller into it as its Owner.

    The authorization model here is deliberately NOT "the caller must hold
    ORGANIZATION_CREATE somewhere", and the reason is structural rather than
    a preference. Creating an organization is the bootstrap step that comes
    *before* any membership exists:

        authenticated user
          -> create organization
          -> creator membership (ACTIVE)
          -> Owner role for that organization
          -> Owner permissions (including organization.create)

    At the moment of the call there is no organization to be a member of, so
    there is no membership row, no role assignment, and therefore no
    permission set that could authorize it. Requiring `organization.create`
    would be circular: the grant that would satisfy the check is created by
    the very operation being checked. The only thing that can be required is
    that the caller is an authenticated, active user - which is exactly what
    `_require_active_user` does - and everything after that is bootstrap
    rather than authorization.

    The flip side, which is why this is safe to ship: an organization is a
    resource the platform provisions for the user who asks for one. There is
    no pre-existing organization whose members this could be used to reach,
    and the new one contains only the creator. Every subsequent operation on
    it *is* permission-checked (`organization.view` for reads,
    `organization.members.manage` for membership writes), and tenant
    isolation for those is enforced by
    `organizations.authorization.require_permission`.

    `ORGANIZATION_CREATE` is still provisioned and still granted to the Owner
    role, so the Owner role's permission set accurately describes the
    organization surface. It is simply never used as a gate - see
    `organizations/authorization.py`'s module docstring.
