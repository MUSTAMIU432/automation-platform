"""
Tenant isolation across the real HTTP boundary (S1-009).

Two fully independent tenants are set up and every organization-scoped
operation is then attempted by each of them against the other:

    User A  ->  Organization A  (creator, Owner role)
    User B  ->  Organization B  (creator, Owner role)

Nothing here is a service-level call. Each request goes through
`django.test.Client` -> middleware -> the GraphQL view -> the schema's own
resolvers -> `organizations.services`/`authorization` -> the database, with
the caller's identity arriving only as a signed `Authorization: Bearer` access
token, exactly as a browser sends it. The services-level suites in
`organizations/tests/` stub this outer half, so a mistake that only shows up
across the boundary (a resolver passing the wrong id, a filter that forgets
the tenant predicate) would not be caught by them.

Two properties are asserted throughout, and the second is the point of the
file:

1. Legitimate access works - A reaches everything in Organization A, B
   reaches everything in Organization B.
2. Cross-tenant access never returns the other tenant's data. A request that
   crosses the boundary returns *nothing* - null, an empty list, or a
   `success: false` payload - and never a partial answer, never a count, and
   never a distinguishable "you do not have access" signal that would confirm
   the foreign object exists.

Property 2 is additionally checked for *leakage*, not just for failure: after
each rejected cross-tenant attempt the test asserts the foreign tenant's data
appears nowhere in the raw response body, so a field that leaked alongside a
rejected parent could not pass unnoticed.
