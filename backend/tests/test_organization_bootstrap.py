"""
The organization bootstrap authorization model (S1-009).

The one place in this project where the obvious authorization rule is the
wrong one. Every other organization-scoped operation is gated on a
permission held through a membership - but *creating* an organization cannot
be, and the reason is structural rather than a policy choice:

    authenticated user
      -> create organization
      -> creator membership (ACTIVE)
      -> Owner role for that organization
      -> Owner permissions (including organization.create)

At the moment `createOrganization` is called there is no organization, so
there is no membership, no role assignment, and no permission set capable of
authorizing it. Requiring `organization.create` would be circular: the grant
that would satisfy the check is created by the very operation being checked,
and the resulting "you are not allowed to create an organization" answer
would be unresolvable by any user, ever.

These tests pin that model in both directions, over real HTTP:

1. The bootstrap works - an authenticated user with no memberships anywhere
   can create an organization, and immediately holds every permission on
   their new organization including `organization.create`.
2. The bootstrap is the *only* thing that is not permission-checked, and it
   is not a loophole - it grants nothing beyond the one organization just
   created, and every other operation on that organization is still
   permission-checked and still tenant-isolated.
3. It is gated on being an active, authenticated user - the one requirement
   that is not circular.
