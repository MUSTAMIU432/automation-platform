"""
The GraphQL schema contract the frontend's documents depend on (S1-009).

`frontend/src/features/organizations/api/organizationApi.ts` selects a
specific set of field names, and there is no way for the Python suite to run
those documents - the two sides are separate processes in separate languages,
and the schema is generated at runtime from the Strawberry types rather than
read from a shared SDL file.

What *is* practical is to pin both ends of the contract from each side:

- `frontend/src/features/organizations/api/organizationApi.test.ts` asserts
  the request documents select exactly `FRONTEND_SELECTED_FIELDS` below.
- This file asserts the schema declares every one of those names, and that it
  declares exactly `SCHEMA_DECLARED_FIELDS` - which is a superset, because a
  client is free to fetch fewer fields than a type has.

A rename on either side therefore fails one of the two suites rather than
surfacing at runtime as a GraphQL `errors` array and an empty screen.

Both lists are deliberately duplicated rather than shared. A single source of
truth would still have to be kept in step with the generated schema, and a
test that reads its expectations from the thing it is testing checks nothing.

Everything here is read from the schema's SDL - the same text a client
receives - rather than from the Strawberry types' Python attributes, because
the names a client asks for are the SDL names. Strawberry applies its own
camelCase conversion to the `snake_case` Python fields on the way out, so
`created_at` is `createdAt` in the schema and asking for the snake_case name
is a query error.
