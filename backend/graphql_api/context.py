"""
GraphQL request context (S1-005).

The one place a resolver gets the current authenticated user from - see
`identity.authentication.get_authenticated_user` for how it's actually
derived from the request's `Authorization` header (JWT signature/expiry/
type validation, then a fresh, `is_active`-filtered database lookup;
never a value the frontend can simply assert). Resolvers should read
`info.context.user` rather than calling that function themselves, so
there's exactly one mechanism authenticating a GraphQL request, not one
reinvented per resolver - see `identity/schema.py`'s `me` query for the
pattern later resolvers (S1-006 and beyond) should follow.
