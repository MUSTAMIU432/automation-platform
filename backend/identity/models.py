"""
Identity domain models.

`User` is the platform account (email/password today; external providers
and future authentication mechanisms build on top of it, not into it).
`ExternalIdentity` is the minimal foundation for linking a User to an
external provider identity (Google now, others later) without putting any
provider-specific field directly on User. `RefreshSession` is the
server-side record backing a refresh credential (see its own docstring for
why a stateless refresh JWT was deliberately not used instead).

    Server-side record backing one issued refresh credential.

    Deliberately not a second, longer-lived JWT: a stateless refresh JWT
    can't be individually revoked (logout, a stolen device, detected replay
    all need to invalidate one specific credential without waiting out its
    lifetime), so the refresh credential is an opaque random string and
    this row is the only place its validity is decided. See
    `identity.authentication` for issuance, rotation and revocation.

    Only a hash of the credential is stored (`token_hash`), the same
    principle as password hashing: if the database leaked, the raw
    credential couldn't be reconstructed or replayed from it. Unlike a
    password, the credential is already high-entropy random data, not a
    low-entropy human-chosen secret, so it's hashed with a fast
    cryptographic hash (SHA-256, in `identity.authentication`) rather than
    a slow, adaptive password hasher - a raw brute-force attack isn't the
    threat model here the way it is for passwords.

    Rotation: using a credential successfully revokes this row
    (`revoked_at`) and links to its replacement (`replaced_by`), rather
    than deleting it. Keeping the revoked row (instead of deleting it) is
    what makes reuse of an already-rotated credential detectable as a
    *revoked* lookup rather than simply "not found" - the row is still
    there to say "this was valid once, and was already used."
