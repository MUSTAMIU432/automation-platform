"""
Identity domain's GraphQL surface.

This module defines Strawberry types to be merged into the root schema
(`graphql_api/schema.py`) via inheritance - it does not instantiate its own
`strawberry.Schema`. See that module's docstring for why: one schema, with
each business domain contributing a slice of it.

Resolvers here stay thin: they translate between GraphQL types and
`identity.services`/`identity.authentication`, which own the actual
validation and business logic.

Two cross-cutting concerns are applied in the resolvers rather than in the
services, because both are properties of *this HTTP entry point* rather than
of the business operation, and because both need the raw request/response
the services deliberately never see:

- Authentication throttling (`identity.throttling`), checked *before* the
  underlying work so an over-limit request never reaches a password hash or
  a Google signature verification. The services stay usable from a
  management command or a future non-HTTP adapter without a request to
  throttle against.
- The HttpOnly refresh-cookie lifecycle, which is a browser concern (its
  Path/SameSite/Secure attributes) and meaningless anywhere else.
