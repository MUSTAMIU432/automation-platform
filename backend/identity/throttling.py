"""
Authentication throttling (S1-009).

The unauthenticated entry points that can be turned into an amplifier -
`login`, `refreshToken`, `googleLogin` and `register` - are the ones this
module guards. Each of them is reachable with no session at all, and the
first two are reachable with a value the caller chooses, so an attacker can
issue unlimited attempts: unlimited guesses against one account, or a spray
across many. The same limit answers it.

Why a cache, and which one. Counting has to be shared by every process: with
a per-process counter, worker 1 blocks the 11th attempt while workers 2..N
each allow 10 more, and a single attacker simply gets N times the budget -
which is precisely the "fragile in-memory mechanism" this exists to avoid.
So the counters live in the `auth_throttle` cache alias (see
config/settings/base.py), and `config/settings/production.py` refuses to start
a deployed environment whose security-critical aliases resolve to a
per-process backend. The same guarantee the Google ID-token replay check
relies on, for the same reason.

The algorithm is a fixed window: a key per (operation, scope, subject) is
created with `cache.add` and then incremented with `cache.incr`. Both are
atomic on every backend that matters (`add` is `SETNX`, `incr` is `INCR` on
Redis; both are lock-guarded in-process for localmem), so a genuine burst of
concurrent requests cannot each read the same count and all be admitted.

Fixed windows, not sliding ones, on purpose: a sliding window needs
per-request timestamps and an atomic range query, which no Django cache
backend offers portably. The cost is the classic boundary burst - up to
`2 * limit` attempts across a window edge - which is not a meaningful
weakening at these limits, and is not worth a bespoke shared-datastore
mechanism.

**Failing closed.** If the cache is unreachable, every attempt is refused
rather than admitted. That is the uncomfortable choice, and it is the
correct one: this limit is the only thing standing between an attacker and
unlimited password guessing, and "the cache is down" is not evidence that
the caller is legitimate. It does mean a cache outage takes authentication
down with it, which is the deliberate trade-off - the alternative is a
silent, invisible removal of a security control.

Subjects are hashed before becoming cache keys. A Redis key is readable in
`MONITOR`, in slow-query logs and in a crash dump; an account's email
address and a client's IP address are personal data that has no business
being stored in plaintext as a cache key.
