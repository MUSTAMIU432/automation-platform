    """
    A refused account-linking collision, reported specifically.

    **This is a deliberate, load-bearing exception to the generic-message
    rule, and the gate that makes it safe is the point.**

    Telling a caller "an account already exists for this email" is only safe
    when the caller has *already* proven they control that exact mailbox -
    and here they have. Reaching this point means the request presented a
    Google-issued ID token that passed signature, issuer, audience and
    expiry verification, and that its own `email_verified` claim is true.
    Google asserts that claim only after confirming control of the mailbox,
    so the caller could have established this fact themselves by checking
    their own inbox.

    The disclosure is therefore not an enumeration oracle, and the asymmetry
    is worth stating plainly because it is what makes the whole difference:

    - An attacker who wants to know whether `victim@example.com` has an
      account **cannot** use this to find out. They cannot mint a Google
      credential for an address they do not control, so the only addresses
      they can ever get an answer about are their own - which they can
      already check.
    - Someone holding a stolen or phished credential for the address is, at
      that point, already inside the mailbox this message is about.

    Without that gate the change *would* be a serious regression, which is
    why `email_verified` is checked rather than assumed. An unverified
    credential proves nothing, and gets GENERIC_GOOGLE_LOGIN_ERROR like
    every other failure.

    What this class must never be used for: distinguishing *which kind* of
    collision occurred (a password account vs a different Google identity),
    revealing anything about the existing account beyond its existence, or
    being raised for any failure other than the email collision. See
    `_resolve_google_user`, which is the only place that raises it.

    model level for exactly this case (see its migration) - registration's
    own validation (`identity.services`) still requires a real phone
    number for that path; this is the one path that legitimately creates

    has already confirmed this person controls the mailbox (the same

    `set_unusable_password()` (Django's own mechanism for exactly this)

    """
    Verify a Google ID token and authenticate (or provision) the associated
    User, then issue the same access token + refresh session login() does.

    Account resolution, in order:

    1. An `ExternalIdentity(provider='google', provider_subject=<sub>)`
       already exists -> authenticate its User. This is the common case
       for a returning Google user; the stable `sub` claim (never the
       email) is what's matched, so a Google account changing its email
       later doesn't lose or duplicate its link.
    2. No such ExternalIdentity, and no User exists with the verified
       email -> provision a new User (see `_provision_google_user`) and
       link it.
    3. No such ExternalIdentity, but a User already exists with that
       email (registered with a password, or created earlier by a
       *different* Google identity reporting the same email) -> refused,
       and reported specifically as `GOOGLE_EMAIL_IN_USE_ERROR` when - and
       only when - the credential's own `email_verified` claim is true.
       This platform never links a new identity to an existing account by
       email match alone, regardless of `email_verified` - see the
       security note below. Only an exact `(provider, provider_subject)`
       match (case 1) ever authenticates into an account that already
       exists; an authenticated "link this Google account to my current
       session" flow, initiated by an already-logged-in user, is the
       intended way to add a second sign-in method to an existing
       account, and is out of scope - see docs/architecture.md.

       What changed, and why only the message: the *refusal* is
       unconditional, but the generic message for it was a usability dead
       end - someone whose address is already registered was told
       "Could not sign in with Google." with nothing to act on, having
       correctly refused to be told why. Disclosing the collision to a
       caller who has just presented a credential Google verified as
       `email_verified` is safe, because reaching that point means they
       have already proven control of this exact mailbox and could
       therefore have established the fact themselves. It is not an
       enumeration oracle: nobody can present a Google credential for an
       address they do not control, so the only addresses anyone can get
       an answer about are their own. The gate is enforced in
       `_email_collision_error`, and every other failure - invalid,
       expired, replayed or unverified credential, unconfigured client id,
       inactive account - still answers GENERIC_GOOGLE_LOGIN_ERROR, so the
       response still cannot be used to find out whether an arbitrary
       address has an account. See `GoogleEmailInUseError`.

       Security note (revised after a dedicated review; this is a
       deliberate, load-bearing decision, not the original design):
       auto-linking by verified email was considered and rejected.
       `email_verified=true` is a real, cryptographically-backed assertion
       that *Google* confirmed mailbox control at some point in the past -
       but it says nothing about whether the person completing *this*
       Google sign-in is the same person who registered the platform
       account under that email, particularly once email addresses can be
       reassigned or reused outside this platform's control (e.g. a
       company reissuing a departed employee's address to someone new, who
       then gets a fresh Google Workspace identity with `email_verified=
       true` for it). Auto-linking would silently and permanently hand
       that new mailbox holder access to the *old* account - with no
       consent, no notification to the original owner, and no audit trail
       - and would do so as this platform's *first* email-provenance-based
       path into an existing account, since no password-reset-by-email
       flow exists yet to compare the risk against. (An earlier version of
       this docstring compared auto-linking to Firebase Authentication's
       default behavior; that comparison was wrong - Firebase's actual
       default for a colliding email is to reject the sign-in with
       `auth/account-exists-with-different-credential` and require the
       existing method first, which is this same refuse-first policy, not
       an argument for the opposite.)

    Every failure - an invalid or replayed token, Google sign-in not
    configured, an inactive user, or an email match in case 3 - raises an
    `AuthenticationError` and every one of them is safe to show verbatim. All
    but the last carry the single generic message, so an unauthenticated
    caller learns nothing about which case occurred. The one exception is a
    case-3 collision reported by an `email_verified` credential, which is
    told the address is taken; that caller has already proven control of the
    mailbox, so it discloses nothing about anyone else's account. See
    `GoogleEmailInUseError`.
